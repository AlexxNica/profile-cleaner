NAME
profile-cleaner - Reduce the size of browser profiles and of email databases by organizing their sqlite databases using sqlite3's vacuum and reindex functions.

SYNOPSIS
profile-cleaner [option]

DESCRIPTION
Profile-cleaner is a very simple shell script that will invoke sqlite3 to vacuum and reindex databases belonging to supported browsers and email clients. It is compatible with profile-sync-daemon so users need not stop psd before cleaning a profile. In fact, profiles will clean much faster when they are synced to tmpfs via psd.

OPTIONS
	c   Clean chromium's profile.

	ck  Clean conkeror's profile(s)*.

	f   Clean firefox's profile(s)*.

	gc  Clean google-chrome's profile.

	h   Clean heftig aurora's profile(s)*.

	m   Clean midori's profile.

	t   Clean thunderbird's profile(s)*.


*Profile-cleaner will parse the respective profiles.ini file and clean all profiles defined therein.

SUPPORTED BROWSERS AND EMAIL CLIENTS
	Currently, the following are supported:
	o Chromium
	o Conkeror
	o Firefox (stable,beta,aurora)
	o Google-chrome
	o Heftig's version of Aurora (https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=117157)
